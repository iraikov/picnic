## Documentation

The main idea of`Picnic` is to combine experimental data on cell
morphology and synthetic cell geometry.  Cell geometry is described as
sets of 3D points and can be one of the following:

* Neurolucida data: cylinders described by start point, end point, diameter
* Synthetic geometry: points along a line, polynomial curve, or angular displacement

Cell placement can be defined by rectangular grids, regular tilings
(e.g. bricks or hexagons), random point distributions.  Connectivity
currently is simply projections based on Euclidean distances between
cell objects.

### Layers

In `Picnic` terminology, a layer describes the placement of cell
objects in 3D space.  The placement is determined by a set of points,
which can be generated by one of the following methods:

* sampling from typical distributions such as uniform or exponential
* point coordinates loaded from a file
* Regular grid defined by spacing in x, y and z direction
* Regular 2D tiling, such as hexagons or bricks with a given side length. In this case, position x and y coordinates are determined by the center point of each generated tile, and the z coordinate is set to zero.

A layer is defined by a point set described by one of the methods
above, and one or more cell objects that are to be placed at
positions determined by the point set. If there are less cell
objects than there are points in the point set, then the cell
objects are copied until an object is placed at each point.

### Cell objects

A cell object consists of a bounding box and a set of connection
points. The connection points can be loaded from a Neurolucida
file, or can be sampled from the trajectory of a parametric curve.

The set of points that belong to a cell object can be further
divided into compartments, e.g. dendrites and axon, which can be
later used when specifying connectivity.

In addition, random perturbations can be applied to the points of
a cell or one of its compartments.

### Projections

Once layers are defined with the different cell types, connectivity is
specified in `Picnic` as projections between layers.

The single type of projection currently supported by `Picnic` is
based on Euclidean distances between the points of the different cell
object. Given a maximum distance, `Picnic` can determine all cell
points in two layers that are close enough to be considered connected.

### Model description language

The following constructs comprise the model description language: 

 INPUT {ID} | {ID} [AS {LOCAL-ID}] [FROM {NAMESPACE}] ...

Declares one or several imported quantities. If the optional AS
parameter is given, then the quantity is imported as {LOCAL-ID}. If
the optional FROM parameter is given, then the quantity is imported
from namespace {NAMESPACE}.

  OUTPUT {ID}

Declares that an existing quantity be exported.

  CONST {ID} = {EXPR}

Declares a constant quantity (its value will be computed at declaration time).

  FUN {ID} ( {ARG-ID} ... ) {EXPR}

Declares a function (a parameterized expression with no free variables).

  {ID} = {EXPR}

Declares an assigned quantity (an expression that can refer to other quantities in the system).

 PROCESS ( {ID} ) = (GENERATOR {F}) (npts {N})

Declares a process quantity. {F} is the generating function that returns the parametric curves for this process.

  COMPONENT ( TYPE {ID} ) ( NAME {ID} ) {ELEMENTS} )

Declares a system component (a quantity that can contain other quantities).
